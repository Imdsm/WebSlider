WebSlider
=========

I'm not quite sure how to describe this, "Lightweight single page slider" doesn't really seem to make that much sense when you think about it. It could be anything!

*Basically*, WebSlider is a project where you have all your "pages" on a single page inside divs, and the divs -- or slides as I call them -- fill the screen, no matter the height. You can then scroll from "page" to "page", allowing a multiple site feel on a single page.

I hope that makes sense.

See an example here: [WebSlider demo](http://imdsm.github.io/WebSlider/).
