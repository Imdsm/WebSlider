WebSlider
=========

I'm not quite sure how to describe this, "Lightweight single page slider" does really seem to make that much sense when you think about it.

Basically, WebSlider is a project where you have all your pages on a single page inside divs, and the divs fill the screen, no matter the height. You can then scroll from "page" to "page", allowing a multiple site feel on a single page.

I hope that makes sense.

See an example here: [WebSlider demo](http://imdsm.github.io/WebSlider/).
